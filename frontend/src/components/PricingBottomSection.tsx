              While our service is free, exposed AI servers can cost developers and companies thousands of dollars in unauthorized usage, security breaches, and remediation efforts. Plus the inevitable "how did this happen" meeting with your boss that nobody wants to attend.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We're not trying to scare you (okay, maybe a little), but leaving your Ollama server wide open is like putting a "Free AI Models - Help Yourself!" sign on the internet. Spoiler alert: people will help themselves, and they won't be polite about it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Help us prevent these costs by responsibly securing your servers and maybe, just maybe, reading the documentation before deploying to production. Your future self will thank you, and so will your security team.
